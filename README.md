# QR_Code_Component
The goal of this project is to create a visually beautiful QR code component that motivates users to advance their knowledge of front-end development.

To achieve a modern, clean look, the component is stylized using CSS and thoughtfully chosen design components. A significant call to action is placed around the image of the QR code. All styling, including colors, font, layout, and responsiveness, is handled by the CSS file, producing a unified and user-friendly design. This project demonstrates a grasp of contemporary front-end design principles by showcasing the efficient use of CSS for styling web components.
